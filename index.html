                <h1>Rename Born A Crime</h1>
                <p>
                    I would rename the Born a crime - <b>"Echoes of My Childhood"</b>. <br>
                    I would say the book narrates Trevor's childhood and most of what happened during his <br>childhood
                    has shaped him to who he is today. He also connects his personal memories to <br>the larger
                    historical
                    happenies of that time. For Trevor to Navigate through the apartheid he <br> used humour as armour.
                    He
                    used it to talk to people and fit in and even to get out of trouble. <br>
                    One of his career paths ends up being comedy.where he uses humour to make a living.
                </p>

                <h1>Reflective blog</h1>
                <p> "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with
                    subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'”
                </p>
                <p>Traditionally, most women were expected to be submissive to their husbands and serve <br>them. I
                    would
                    say they were raised up to be kept by men. Likewise in morden relationships <br>
                    this is not the case. In modern society the definition of gender roles seems to have changed. <br>
                    what was termed to be men jobs and roles, women roles and jobs has turned to be an outdated notion.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just as Particia defied the rules of tradition and made a different life for herself, most women
                    <br>
                    tend to do the same currently. They aspire to take roles which previously we designated only <br>for
                    men,
                    and even do them better than men. Though society still expects her to be under <br>
                    a man. <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    My opinion would be: Love should not be a way for a man to cage a woman but it should be <br>
                    honouring each other's freedom, even when the tradition dictates otherwise. True <br>
                    parternship is built on mutual respect, not outdated expectations. In emporing each other, <br>
                    bith men and women can achieve a more balanced and fulfiling life together.
