                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    According to Wikipedia, Born a Crime: Stories from a South African childhood <br>
                    is an autobiographical comedy book written by South African comedian Trevor <br>
                    Noah, published in 2016. Trevor narrates stories from his childhood in a <br>
                    humourous manner. The book intertwins the apartheid and his life. The title <br>
                    Born a crime is supported to different parts of the book,for instance: <br>
                    when he explain how the apartheid made a law that stated that black South <br>
                    African should not intermarry with the white people. Noah was born a crime <br>
                    for this parents went aganist this law.

            <h1>Renaming Born A Crime</h1>
            <p>
                I would rename the Born a crime - <b>"Echoes of My Childhood"</b>. <br>
                I would say the book narrates Trevor's childhood and most of what happened during his childhood has
                shaped him to who he is today. He also connects his <br>personal
                memories to the larger historical happenies of that time. For Trevor to Navigate through the apartheid
                he used humour as armour. He used it to talk <br>to people and
                fit in and even to get out of trouble. One of his career paths ends up being comedy.where he uses humour
                to make a living.

            <h1>Reflective blog</h1>
            <p> "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with
                subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because <br> his dream is to put her in a cage.'”
            </p>
            <p>
                Abel like most men want to control their women, whereby you will find out that these women end up not
                having a say in their own marriages.
                This indeed <br>make these women caged and have no say in this marriages. There are cases where some
                women voice out and speak up about this sort of oppression <br>
                but not all.
            </p>
            <p>Traditionally, most women were expected to be submissive to their husbands and serve them. I would say
                they were raised up to be kept by men. Unlikewise, <br> in
                morden relationships this is not the case. In modern society the definition of gender roles seems to
                have changed. What was termed to be men jobs <br>and roles,
                women roles and jobs has turned to be an outdated notion. Let's take an example of a career path like
                engineering, previously it was a field <br> dominanated by men,
                over the years this has changed and more women have taken the space and dominanated.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Just as Particia defied the rules of tradition and made a different life for herself, most women tend to
                do the same currently. They aspire to take roles <br>
                which previously we designated only for men, and even do them better than men. Though society still
                expects her to be under a man. Now women choose <br> who they want to become and go an extract mile of
                creating their own destinies and making their own stories.
            </p>


            <p>
                My opinion would be: Love should not be a way for a man to cage a woman but it should be honouring each
                other's freedom, even when the tradition dictates <br>
                otherwise. True parternship is built on mutual respect, not outdated expectations. In emporing each
                other, bith men and women can achieve a more balanced <br>and fulfiling life together.
